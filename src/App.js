          <br />
          Terms & Conditions By downloading or using the app, these terms will
          automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you
          read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy,
          or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way.
          You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app,
          and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages,
          or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks,
          copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights
          related to it, still belong to GASTOS.
          <br />
          <br />
          Any user signing up on this will be considered as GASTOS PROVIDER and
          he/she agrees to offer a commission Percentage, given text field in
          shop profile, according to his/her own comfort of business so that we
          can use it as a discount on every billed amount of the GASTOS
          customer.
          <br />
          <br />
          We hereby declare that the payment of the billed amount after
          discounting will be directly reflected in the PROVIDER’s account as of
          which we don’t keep any money in-between the transaction.
          <br />
          The received amount will be only X% less (X = value of percentage
          commission given by the provider) as of the bill created by the
          PROVIDER.
          <br />
          The PROVIDER’s UPI address and payment receivable information will be
          asked and will not disclosed or shared to anyone or anywhere.
          <br />
          The information which will be visible in our main application and
          before the users are mentioned below along with their purpose:
          <br />
          • Images – All images posted by the provider will be shown in his
          profile page in the user application (their cover photo of the shop
          and other images related to their businesses)
          <br />
          • Owner Name – At Shop profile page so that user can know about the
          Provider
          <br />
          • Shop Address – At shop profile to help user to get clear idea about
          the shop address and can reach there
          <br />
          • Shop Co-ordinates – At shop profile so that user can directly
          navigate to the shop location saved by the Provider
          <br />
          • Commission Percentage – At shop profile in user app as well as in
          other pages inside user application so that user can see how much
          discount the shop is giving, as we are not keeping money in between
          the transaction so the entered Commission value will be depending on
          their business and how much they want to offer and grow.
          <br />
          • Contact Number – At shop profile page in GASTOS user application so
          that a communication can be done between the both for services related
          to their business or order delivery (if they provide) or order pickup
          (if they provide)
          <br />
          <br />
          GASTOS is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and
          efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make
          changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for
          any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services
          without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
          <br />
          The GASTOS PROVIDER app stores and processes personal data that you
          have provided to us, in order to provide our Service. It’s your
          responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We
          therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone,
          which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations
          imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make
          your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
          compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the
          GASTOS PROVIDER app won’t work properly or at all.
          <br />
          <br />
          You should be aware that there are certain things that GASTOS will not
          take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the
          app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be
          Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but GASTOS cannot
          take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if
          you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data
          allowance left.
          <br />
          If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should
          remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network
          provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your
          mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the
          connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In
          using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges,
          including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home
          territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming.
          If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the
          app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission
          from the bill payer for using the app.
          <br />
          Along the same lines, GASTOS cannot always take responsibility for the
          way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays
          charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail
          the Service, GASTOS cannot accept responsibility.
          <br />
          With respect to GASTOS’s responsibility for your use of the app, when
          you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we
          endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do
          rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make
          it available to you. GASTOS accepts no liability for any loss, direct
          or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this
          functionality of the app.
          <br />
          At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently
          available on Android – the requirements for system (and for any
          additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to)
          may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to
          keep using the app. GASTOS does not promise that it will always update
          the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android
          version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise
          to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We
          may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it
          at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we
          tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses
          granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the
          app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
          <br />
